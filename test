        "technical_project": "Oh, I just loved working on a project where I used computer vision to build a sign language recognition system! As a linguistics minor, I've always been fascinated by languages, and sign language holds a special place in my heart. I used TensorFlow to train a model that could detect and recognize hand gestures, and it was incredibly rewarding to see it in action. I worked with a group of friends, and it was amazing to see how our diverse skills and interests came together to create something really cool. We even pitched it to a local organization that supports deaf students!",

        "technical_project": "I once built a blockchain-based music sharing platform called Melodia. I'm a huge music lover, and I wanted to explore blockchain technology, so I combined my two passions. Users could upload and share their own music, and the platform would track royalties and artist credits. I used Figma for the UI design, and MongoDB for the database. I also experimented with Smart Contracts on Ethereum to manage the distribution of digital assets. Working on Melodia allowed me to learn about blockchain, while also bringing a unique idea to life. It was a blast, and I love sharing it with fellow music enthusiasts!",
